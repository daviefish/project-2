// CALISTHENICS LOG APP !!!

Summary of Idea
    - The calisthenics log app will track user's progress
    - Each user will be able to track their progress with specific exercises (for example, a handstand) by uploading videos and text content to display their progress at a point in time
    - Each user will continue to post additional data as time goes on

Summary of MVP
    - Initially there will be 2 primary models - Users and Topics
    - Each User will be able to post many Topics

Stretch Goals
    - I would like to create a third model - Comments
    - I want users to be able to post Comments on User's Topics
